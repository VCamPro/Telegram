Phishing BOT Telegram is a tool that mimics the Telegram login page to capture login information and scan QR codes for authentication. After logging in, the account's session is saved. You can then manage the account on your personal web platform as if it were a logged-in account on Telegram. Additionally, it allows you to change the 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) without needing the old password.

As you have seen in the video above, there will be login via User:Password and login via QR code. When an account is logged in, it will automatically save the session of that account. I can take full control such as viewing messages, changing information, and changing the 2-factor authentication password without needing the old password. Below is the panel of the system.
