Phishing BOT Telegram is a tool that mimics the Telegram login page to capture login information and scan QR codes for authentication. After logging in, the account's session is saved. You can then manage the account on your personal web platform as if it were a logged-in account on Telegram. Additionally, it allows you to change the 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) without needing the old password.

As you have seen in the video above, there will be login via User:Password and login via QR code. When an account is logged in, it will automatically save the session of that account. I can take full control such as viewing messages, changing information, and changing the 2-factor authentication password without needing the old password. Below is the panel of the system.

#SUMMARY OF THE TOOL'S FEATURES:

- Import and export the friends list on the account.
- Spy on existing messages on the account.
- Save all messages to the data (even if deleted on both sides, they will still be available in the data).
- Change personal information (name, account name, status, profile picture).
- Change the second-level password and email (no need for the old second-level password or email for verification).
- Create groups and channels on the logged-in account.
- Join groups that you specify.
- Download images and videos from a channel or group.
- Retrieve the UID list of members from a competitor’s group.
 -Add contacts from ( @username @uid ).
- Send bulk messages to contacts.
- Increase views and emoji reactions on a channel's posts.
- And many more functions. I will update the bot to interact automatically between accounts, which will save you time. The code is written in PHP, so it’s easy to use without complicated steps. You just need PHP 8.3 hosting to use it.
